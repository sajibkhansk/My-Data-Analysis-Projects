# SQL Painting Project

This project involves analyzing a dataset related to paintings, artists, museums, and various attributes associated with them using SQL queries.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following tables:

- `artist`: Contains information about artists.
- `canvas_size`: Provides details about different canvas sizes.
- `image_link`: Stores links to images of paintings.
- `museum`: Holds information about museums.
- `museum_hours`: Contains museum opening hours.
- `subject`: Contains subjects of paintings.
- `work`: Stores details about paintings.
- `product_size`: Provides details about product sizes associated with paintings.
- 
## Exploring the dataset 

```sql
SELECT * FROM artist; -- 421
SELECT * FROM canvas_size; -- 200
SELECT * FROM image_link; -- 14775
SELECT * FROM museum; -- 57
SELECT * FROM museum_hours; -- 351
SELECT * FROM  subject; -- 6771
SELECT * FROM work; -- 14776
SELECT * FROM product_size; -- 110347
```


## SQL Queries and Outputs

Here are the SQL queries along with their outputs:

1. **Fetch all the paintings which are not displayed in any museums**

```sql
SELECT * FROM work
WHERE museum_id IS NULL;
```
-- Output --  
There are 10,223 paintings which are not displayed on any museums.

2. **Are there museuems without any paintings**

```sql
SELECT M.* 
FROM MUSEUM M
LEFT JOIN WORK W
ON M.MUSEUM_ID = W.MUSEUM_ID
WHERE W.MUSEUM_ID IS NULL;
```
-- Output --  
There is no museuems without any painting

3. **How many paintings have an asking price of more than their regular price?**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(WORK_ID)
FROM PRODUCT_SIZE
WHERE SALE_PRICE > REGULAR_PRICE;
```
-- Output --
There is no paintings have an asking price of more than their regular price.


4. **Identify the paintings whose asking price is less than 50% of its regular price**
```sql
SELECT work_id
FROM PRODUCT_SIZE
WHERE SALE_PRICE < REGULAR_PRICE / 2;
```
-- Output --
There are  5 paintings whose asking price is less than 50% of its regular price.

5. **Which canva size costs the most?**
```sql
SELECT C.LABEL, P.SALE_PRICE
FROM PRODUCT_SIZE P
LEFT JOIN CANVAS_SIZE C
ON P.SIZE_ID = C.SIZE_ID
ORDER BY SALE_PRICE DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
-- Output --
| Label                   | Sale Price |
|-------------------------|------------|
| 48" x 96" (122 cm x 244 cm) | 1115   |

6. **Delete duplicate records from work, product_size, subject and image_link tables**
```sql
-- DELETING FROM WORK TABLE
DELETE FROM WORK
WHERE WORK_ID IN (
    SELECT WORK_ID
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            WORK_ID,

-- DELETING FROM SUBJECT TABLE

DELETE FROM SUBJECT
WHERE (WORK_ID, SUBJECT) IN (
    SELECT WORK_ID, SUBJECT
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            WORK_ID, 
            SUBJECT,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY WORK_ID, SUBJECT ORDER BY WORK_ID) AS RowNum
        FROM 
            SUBJECT
    ) AS Subquery
    WHERE RowNum > 1
);

-- DELETING FROM IMAGE_LINK TABLE

DELETE FROM IMAGE_LINK
WHERE (WORK_ID, URL, thumbnail_small_url, thumbnail_large_url) IN (
    SELECT WORK_ID, URL, thumbnail_small_url, thumbnail_large_url
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            WORK_ID, 
            URL, 
            thumbnail_small_url, 
            thumbnail_large_url,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY WORK_ID, URL, thumbnail_small_url, thumbnail_large_url ORDER BY WORK_ID) AS RowNum
        FROM 
            IMAGE_LINK
    ) AS Subquery
    WHERE RowNum > 1
);

```
-- Output --
All duplicate recrod deleted from selected Table.

7. **Identify the museums with invalid city information in the given dataset**
```sql
SELECT * FROM museum
WHERE  city REGEXP '^[0-9]';
```
-- Output --

MySQL doesn't have certain pseudo-columns like CTID because 
MySQL and PostgreSQL are different database management systems 
with different architectures and feature sets.
```
